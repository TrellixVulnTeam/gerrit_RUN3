Eclipse Setup
=============

This setup is about installing Gerrit into an Eclipse workspace
for development and debugging, especially with the GWT hosted
mode debugger.


User Library
------------

  Window > Preferences
  Java > Build Path > User Libraries

Create a User Library called "GWT":

  New

  Name: GWT
  Add JARs...

  * Select gwt-user.jar from the $(GWT_SDK) directory.
  * Select gwt-dev-$(GWT_OS).jar from the $(GWT_SDK) directory.


Maven Plugin
------------

- Install the Maven Integration plugins:

  http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/


Pre-Build
---------

- Ensure jgit has been installed in your maven repository:

  (cd ../jgit/jgit-maven/jgit/ && mvn install)


Import Projects
---------------

- Import appdist using General -> Maven Projects

  Uncheck "jgit".  You don't want to import it.  The Maven project
  is configured in a non-standard way and the Eclipse plugin can't
  import it correctly.

- Right click on gwtorm, Maven -> Update Project Configuration to
  force a compile of the generted ANTLR sources.  This fixes the
  compile errors identified after import.


Configure Database
------------------

- Open gerrit-devdb/src/main/config

- Copy GerritServer.properties_example to GerritServer.properties

- Configure your database for debugging in hosted mode.


Launch
------

- Open Run->Debug Configurations... 

- Under Java Application find "gerrit_debug" (not Mac OS X)
  or "gerrit_macos" (Mac OS X only) to start the GWT hosted
  mode browser and debug through Eclipse.
