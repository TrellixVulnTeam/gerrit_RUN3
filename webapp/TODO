Bugs
----

If a user never logs in, someone else can grab their nickname
See the issue tracker at code.google.com/p/gerrit for more bugs

Data Cleaning
-------------

Email addresses should be lowercased before comparing
Nicknames too???
Nicknames should not be allowed to contain multiple internal spaces
    nor internal whitespace other than space

Sending Mail
------------

Should allow registered nicknames in Reviewers and CC fields
Normalize emails to nicknames in these fields even when editing, if known

Issues
------

Archive issues (that's per user rather than per issue)

Patch Sets
----------

Edit patch set message
Delete patch sets

Searching, Organizing
---------------------

View all open issues by base, or by repository
View all closed issues (issue 15 in the tracker)

Commenting
----------

Add stars
Add non-inline comments per file, per patchset, per issue
Keyboard shortcut for entering a comment at the blue line
    (isn't this already in the JS code?)

Diffs and Patches
-----------------

Improve UI for selecting patch set deltas; handle missing files better
Syntax colorization
Record revision and show in UI; indicate action (add/edit/delete)
Add line length option
Need a more powerful way to specify the URL for finding a revision (?)

User Experience
---------------

Make Edit Issue show the form inline instead of opening a new page?
Right-justify the "Id" and "Drafts (mine)" headings in the Issues list table

Software Engineering
--------------------
