= Gerrit Code Review - Core Plugins

[[definition]]
== What are core plugins?

Core plugins are plugins that are packaged within the Gerrit war file. This
means during the link:pgm-init.html[Gerrit initialization] they can be easily
installed without downloading any additional files.

To make working with core plugins easy, they are linked as
link:https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/refs/heads/master/.gitmodules[Git
submodules] in the `gerrit` repository. E.g. this means they can be easily
link:dev-readme.html#clone[cloned] together with Gerrit.

The core plugins are developed and maintained by the Gerrit maintainers
and the Gerrit community.
