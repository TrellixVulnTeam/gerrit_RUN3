Gerrit2 - Command Line Tool
===========================

Executing Commands
------------------

Aside from the standard Git server side actions, Gerrit supports
several other commands over its internal SSH daemon.  As Gerrit does
not provide an interactive shell, the commands must be triggered
from an ssh client, for example:

  $ ssh -p 29418 review.example.com gerrit ls-projects

For more details on how to determine the correct SSH port number,
see link:user-upload.html#test_ssh[Testing Your SSH Connection].

git upload-pack::
