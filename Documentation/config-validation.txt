Gerrit Code Review - Commit Validation
======================================

Gerrit supports link:dev-plugins.html[plugin-based] validation of
commits.

Plugins implementing the `CommitValidationListener` interface can
perform additional validation checks against new commits.

If the commit fails the validation, the plugin can either provide a
message that will be sent back to the git client, or throw an exception
which will cause the commit to be rejected.

Validation applies to both commits uploaded via `git push`, and new
commits generated via Gerrit's Web UI features such as the rebase, revert
and cherry-pick buttons.

Out of the box, Gerrit includes a plugin that checks the length of the
subject and body lines of commit messages on uploaded commits.
