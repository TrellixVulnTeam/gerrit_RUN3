= reindex

== NAME
reindex - Rebuild the secondary index

== SYNOPSIS
--
'java' -jar gerrit.war 'reindex' [<OPTIONS>]
--

== DESCRIPTION
Rebuilds the secondary index.

== OPTIONS
--threads::
	Number of threads to use for indexing.

--recheck-mergeable::
	Recheck the mergeable flag on all open changes. For each open change,
	look up for which commit the mergeability check was last done and if
	this commit is different from the HEAD commit of the change's destination
	branch, recompute the mergeability flag of the change by checking if the
	commit of the current patch set can be merged into the destination branch.
	Because this operation is computationally expensive, it is not enabled
	by default.

--schema-version::
	Schema version to reindex; default is most recent version.

--output::
	Prefix for output; path for local disk index, or prefix for remote index.

--verbose::
	Output debug information for each change.

--dry-run::
	Dry run.  Don't write anything to index.

== CONTEXT
The secondary index must be enabled. See
link:config-gerrit.html#index.type[index.type].
