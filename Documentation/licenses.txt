The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry
and Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export
Commodity Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes
information security software using or performing cryptographic
functions with asymmetric algorithms.  The form and manner of
this distribution makes it eligible for export under the License
Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception
(see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13)
for both object code and source code.

Gerrit includes an SSH daemon (Apache SSHD), to support authenticated
uploads of changes directly from `git push` command line clients.

Gerrit includes an SSH client (JSch), to support authenticated
replication of changes to remote systems, such as for automatic
updates of mirror servers, or realtime backups.

For either feature to function, Gerrit requires the
link:http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/security/[Java Cryptography extensions]
and/or the
