Gerrit2 Feature Roadmap
=======================

Offline Support
---------------

Initially we will use Google Gears, but HTML 5 will include
standardized offline application support that we should make
use of.  With GWT we can target both.  The plan is to initially
target Google Gears, and add HTML 5 support once Gerrit 2 is
mostly functional and/if at least one major browser supports it.

Federated Instances
-------------------

Gerrit 2 instances should be able to forward changes between
each other.  This couples with the next item ("No Google") to
allow corporate contributors to open source projects to use a
Gerrit 2 server internally to review (and scrub protected IP)
prior to submitting changes upstream to a public Gerrit server
and an established open source project.
