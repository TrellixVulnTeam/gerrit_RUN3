The refs/notes/review namespace
===============================

Summary
-------

`refs/notes/review` is a special reference that Gerrit creates on repositories
to store information about code reviews.

When a repository is cloned from Gerrit, the `refs/notes/review` reference is
not included by default.  It has to be manually fetched:

====
  $ git fetch origin refs/notes/review:refs/notes/review
====

It is also possible to
link:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html[configure git]
to always fetch `refs/notes/review`:

====
  $ git config --add remote.origin.fetch refs/notes/review:refs/notes/review
  $ git fetch
====

When `refs/notes/review` is fetched on a repository, the Gerrit review
information can be included in the git log output:

====
   $ git log --show-notes=review
====
